# Wilma AI

> Your AI study buddy that attends Zoom lectures and emails you study notes

## Overview
Wilma AI automatically joins your online classes, transcribes lectures, and generates organized study notes as downloadable PDFs. Students simply paste a Zoom link and class name, and Wilma handles the rest - attending the meeting, creating comprehensive notes with highlighted key concepts, and delivering professional documents straight to their inbox. Built for UA students who want to focus on learning, not note-taking.
